For project 3 I am taking a bit of inspiration from Depression Quest and want to create a game that follows a girl in her late teens with a restrictive eating disorder as the main character. I plan to include depictions of ways that this issue seeps into social situations, relationships, and the MC's private moments. I also want to include other characters, such as a friend, a family member or two, and possibly classmates. The story will start out in order but become more nonlineatr as the player keeps progressing. The player will be able to make choices that directly influence later events in the MC's life.
