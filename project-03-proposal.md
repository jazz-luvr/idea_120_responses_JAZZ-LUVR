For project 3 I am taking a bit of inspiration from Depression Quest and want to create a game that follows a girl in her late teens with a restrictive eating disorder as the main character. I plan to include depictions of ways that this issue seeps into social situations, relationships, and the MC's private moments. I also want to include other characters, such as a recurring friend, a family member or two, and possibly classmates. The story will be non-linear and include fragments of specific memories or other periods of the MC's life out of order. The player will be able to make choices that directly influence what happens in the MC's life (things like interactions at school, choosing what to wear or eat/not eat, and maybe even diary entries).
